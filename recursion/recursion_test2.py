'''
The task is to write a function Brackets(int n) that prints all
combinations of well-formed brackets from 1...n. 'n' is the number
 of pairs.

e.g. For Brackets(3) the output would be

()
(())  ()()
((()))  (()())  (())()  ()(())  ()()()

Run your 'n' from 1 to 10, and output (to STDOUT) the bracket combinations
for each value of 'n'.

Test cases: Not set for this problem, because depending on your implementation,
you could be printing brackets in any order.
